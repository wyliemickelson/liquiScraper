TODO
- make function to get all uncompleted tournaments in DATABASE
- make function that will update all uncompleted tournaments, waiting 30 seconds between updates in order to comply with liquipedia api guidelines and not overload their server
- refactor generating tournament to also wait 30 seconds between fetches to liquipedia
- set abbreviated team names in scraper instead of frontend, that way they are editable
